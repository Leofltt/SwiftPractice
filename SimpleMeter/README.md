# PhonoCam

## Summary

PhonoCam is a camera app that takes a photo along with an audio recording at the same time. Opening an app will start recording sound. When the user takes a photo, the audio recording is saved together. The app also has a library view where users can go through each captured moment. This app is adapted from [Norihisa Nagano](https://github.com/7gano) who originally distributed PhonoCamLite through the iPhone Core Audio Programming book.

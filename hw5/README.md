# navProcessor

## Summary

Welcome back to Objective-C! This project illustrates working with stack-based navigation and also shows some ways to manage object instances across projects.

## Topics Covered

- Stack-based navigation.
- The Singleton design pattern.
- Creating and using a simple XY control pad.
- The Csound Binding protocol in detail.
- Using the microphone.
- Checking to see if headphones are connected using apple's AVFoundation API.
- The forEach method.

## Assignment

Modify this project to add and/or change some functionality. The .csd file can also be substituted or modified. A good exercise is also to try to recreate some of this project's functionality from scratch â€“ it is available as a reference, but re-implementing these behaviors can be helpful practice. Additionally, re-implementation may help in absorbing new syntax.

__Starter exercises to the reader:__

- Try to add another ViewController and corresponding Csound instrument.
- Try to manually add more value bindings to Csound channels using the CsoundBinding protocol.

# csoundSynthesizer

## Summary

csoundSynthesizer is a simple synthesizer that shows how to integrate the Csound-iOS API into a rudimentary but useful keyboard-format synthesizer.

## Topics Covered

- Drawing and using a keyboard with the CsoundVirtualKeyboard class from the examples.
- Managing Csound instrument instances in realtime from the UI.
- More Swift syntax and control flow (for-in, etc.)

## Assignment

Modify this project to add and/or change some functionality. The .csd file can also be substituted or modified. A good exercise is also to try to recreate this project's core features from scratch - it is available as a reference, but re-implementing some of these behaviors can be helpful practice.

__Starter exercises to the reader:__

- Try to bridge more Objective-C code, perhaps from another API or Objective-C class.
- Add more controls to the synthesizer: more timbres, octave displacement, more and controllable FX, etc.
- Access more of the Csound-iOS API from Swift: CsoundMotion, more CsoundUI, MidiWidgetsManager, etc. perhaps to add MIDI CCs, for example.
